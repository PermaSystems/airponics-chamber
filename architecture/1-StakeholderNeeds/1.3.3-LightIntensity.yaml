name: "Light Intensity"
statement: "The required light intensity, or photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), varies per plant and growth phase; e.g., the PPFD for tomato/cucumber is 75 to 300 umol/m2/s for seedling phase, 250 to 400 umol/m2/s for vegetative phase, & 600+ umol/m2/s for generative phase."
