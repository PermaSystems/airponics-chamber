name: "Usable Light Spectrum"
statement: "Infra-red light should be filtered out, as to utilize only the portion of the light spectrum needed for plant growth and to reduce heat build up inside of the plant cells; blue light (mid-400 nm) is beneficial for seedling and vegetative growth; red light (600 to 640 nm) is beneficial for germination and generative (flowering/blooming) growth."
